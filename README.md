CarrierDetect
================
A simple app to display home carrier name & some network information.

Note:
 - home carrier name is read from SIM, does not change when roaming
 - network information is based on whatever network the device is connected to, regardless of WiFi or 3G connection
 - network information requires Internet connection to work
